# FREEBEE PERSONAL BLOG - Content Management Guide

## How to Add New Blog Posts

### 1. Create a New Markdown File

Create a new `.md` file in the `src/content/blog/` directory with the following naming convention:
- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Example: `ctf-writeup-web-exploit.md`

### 2. Add Frontmatter

Each post must include frontmatter at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
title: "YOUR POST TITLE IN CAPS"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post content."
category: "CATEGORY_NAME"
color: "red" # Options: red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple
date: "2024-01-15" # Format: YYYY-MM-DD
author: "FREEBEE" # Default author
featured: false # Set to true to feature on homepage
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"] # Optional tags
---
```

### 3. Write Your Content

After the frontmatter, write your content using Markdown:

```markdown
# Your Main Heading

Your content goes here. You can use:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- [Links](https://example.com)

## Subheadings

More content...

> Blockquotes for emphasis

```code
Code blocks
```
```

### 4. Available Categories
