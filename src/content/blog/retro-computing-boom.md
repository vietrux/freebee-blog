# BUILDING A SECURITY SCANNER

I recently built a custom security scanner tool for web application vulnerability assessment. Let me walk you through the development process and key features.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Tool:** WebSec Scanner  
**Language:** Python 3.9+  
**Purpose:** Automated web application security testing  
**Features:** SQL injection, XSS, directory traversal detection

## ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

```python
class SecurityScanner:
    def __init__(self, target_url):
        self.target = target_url
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.vulnerabilities = []
    
    def scan_sql_injection(self):
        # SQL injection testing logic
        pass
    
    def scan_xss(self):
        # XSS testing logic
        pass
```

## KEY FEATURES

### 1. SQL Injection Detection

Tests common SQL injection payloads:
- Union-based injection
- Boolean-based blind injection
- Time-based blind injection

### 2. XSS Vulnerability Scanner

Detects reflected and stored XSS:
- Script tag injection
- Event handler injection
- DOM-based XSS

### 3. Directory Traversal

Checks for path traversal vulnerabilities:
- `../` sequences
- URL encoding bypasses
- Null byte injection

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Request Handling

```python
def make_request(self, url, params=None):
    try:
        response = self.session.get(url, params=params, timeout=10)
        return response
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Request failed: {e}")
        return None
```

### Vulnerability Reporting

```python
def report_vulnerability(self, vuln_type, url, payload):
    vuln = {
        'type': vuln_type,
        'url': url,
        'payload': payload,
        'timestamp': datetime.now()
    }
    self.vulnerabilities.append(vuln)
```

## USAGE EXAMPLE

```bash
python scanner.py --url http://target.com --scan sql,xss
```

## LESSONS LEARNED

- Proper error handling is crucial
- Rate limiting prevents overwhelming targets
- Comprehensive logging aids debugging
- Modular design enables easy extension

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

- Multi-threading for faster scanning
- Custom payload support
- Integration with popular security tools
- Web-based reporting interface
